ember-cli-deploy is just an Ember CLI addon so it's super easy to install:

```
ember install ember-cli-deploy
```

But ember-cli-deploy doesn't do much by itself. You also need to install plugins to actually do the deployment work.

Jump on over to the [Plugins Overview](../plugins-overview) to understand how plugins work. When you feel comfortable with the concept of a plugin,
you can see the list of those that are currently available on the [Plugins Page](../plugins).
